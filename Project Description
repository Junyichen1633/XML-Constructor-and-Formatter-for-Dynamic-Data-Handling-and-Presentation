HTML Constructor & Formatter
Objective: Design a library in any language that allows developers to read, manipulate, and format standard XML output.

Detailed Requirements:

Reading and Constructing XML:

Reading: The library should read XML strings and format the output. The XML being read must be standard XML.
Reference for XML syntax: W3Schools XML Syntax
Constructing: The library should be able to construct XML via an API and format the output.
Output:

Support for Different Configurations:
Compact or One-Line Format:

Compact:
<note>
  <subNote>
    haha
  </subNote>
</note>

One line:
<note><subNote>haha</subNote></note>

Indentation:
In compact mode, support 2 spaces, 4 spaces, and tab characters for indentation.
Support empty element expression, forced compact format, forced open format, or retain the read state.

Compact:
<note>
  <subNote />
</note>

Open:
<note>
  <subNote></subNote>
</note>

Retaining the original read state means that if the original XML was compact, the output should also be compact. If the original XML was open, the output should be open.
Attribute Alignment: Support different display styles: continuous or aligned.

Continuous:

<note happy="yes" sad="no">
  <subNote />
</note>

Align:
<note happy="yes"
      sad="no">
  <subNote />
</note>
